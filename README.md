# Football (soccer) match manager

A few years ago, I had to manage a football tournment and we used a lot of paper.
This atempts to solve that.

## Features (for the manager point-of-view)

- add teams
- add player info
- add mathes
- within a match:
	- add goals
  - make player's substitution
  - add cards
- tournment goal's list
- tournment card's list
